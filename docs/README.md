## Prerequisites
In order to run our application, you must have Python 3.9 installed. It is also recommended to have and use PyCharm the Python IDE to make it as easy as possible, but it can be done only from the command line. You also of course need Git to clone the repository. PyCharm has built in version control that allows you to perform all Git operations in PyCharm. Once the repo has been cloned, you must install the required dependencies. The dependencies are listed below. PyCharm has a very easy to use package manager, where you can search the package name and install with one click. Now that your environment is set up, you should be nearly ready to go. 
1. Kivy
2. KivyMD
3. Pyrebase4
4. firebase-auth
## Run Instructions
Once all prerequisites have been met, you are ready to run the program. You can simply click run to beign the program. The first run will ask for a run configuration, and it is very important that the script section (which determines what will be run) is the main.py file. You should navigate to wherever you stored the repository, go to the src, and select main.py. After this, you are all set to run the application as you want.

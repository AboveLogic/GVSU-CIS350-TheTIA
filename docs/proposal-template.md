# Introduction

We plan to construct and exercise/gym companion app to make workouts more structured and effective. We will have a home screen where the user has the ability to choose between creating their own workout or choosing a preset workout from a list we have created. If the user chooses to create their own workout, we will have a large list of workouts for them to choose from. Once they choose a workout it will ask them how many reps/sets and how much time in between. This process will continue until the user indicates they are satisfied with the workout they have created and are ready to begin. The user will then be able to begin the workout. The app will have instructions on how to complete the exercise properly, as well as the number of sets/reps the user indicated. When the user has completed a given exercise, they must tap to indicate they are moving on to the next one, at which point the rest timer will begin, and once over the workout will resume.  

If we have extra time on the project there are several extra features we would like to add including a platform for users to share and save others workouts. We would also like to add a customizable music player to play music directly from the app. In addition, when the workout is completed the user will have a congratulatory screen as well as a prompt to drink water and rest, in order to prepare for the next workout. We are excited to work on this app and believe it will be a fun challenge.
# Anticipated Technologies

1. GitHub/Git
2. A Java capable IDE 

# Method/Approach
 
 We are choosing to use the scrum method. We plan to use GitHub's features as our scrum board. Our weekly schedule will be broken down into smaller tasks based on the goal for that week. Each person will choose a task until they are completed and then help the others. We are going to have two team members focused on functionality and one member focused on stylistic improvements.  

# Estimated Timeline

1. Home Page (first-second week)
2. Begin Exercise Library and premade workouts (third week)
3. Add create your own routine function (fourth-fifth week)
4. Add reps/sets that user inputs and rest time/timer (sixth week)
5. Add search function with tagged workouts (eg. arms, pull) (seventh)
6. Add a calendar to schedule workouts (eighth-ninth week)
7. Add save feature (ninth-tenth week)
8. IF TIME: add social media sharing and music player (remaining time)


# Anticipated Problems
1. Overall inexperience in app development
2. Inexperience with using git in a group setting
3. Inexperience with extensive programming/large projects 
4. Concern over deadline/meeting requirements

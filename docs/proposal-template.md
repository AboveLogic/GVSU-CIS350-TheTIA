# Introduction

We plan to construct and exercise/gym companion app to make workouts more structured and effective. We will have a home screen where the user has the ability to choose between creating their own workout or choosing a preset workout from a list we have created. If the user chooses to create their own workout, we will have a large list of workouts for them to choose from. Once they choose a workout it will ask them how many reps/sets and how much time in between. This process will continue until the user indicates they are satisfied with the workout they have created and are ready to begin. The user will then be able to begin the workout. The app will have instructions on how to complete the exercise properly, as well as the number of sets/reps the user indicated. When the user has completed a given exercise, they must tap to indicate they are moving on to the next one, at which point the rest timer will begin, and once over the workout will resume.  

If we have extra time on the project there are several extra features we would like to add including a platform for users to share and save others workouts. We would also like to add a customizable music player to play music directly from the app. In addition, when the workout is completed the user will have a congratulatory screen as well as a prompt to drink water and rest, in order to prepare for the next workout. We are excited to work on this app and believe it will be a fun challenge.

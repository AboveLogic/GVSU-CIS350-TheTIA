# The TIA

Our goal is to create a functional workout/gym companion app. We expect to have a title screen where the user can choose to create their own workout routine or choose from a preset routine. If the user selects to create their own workout, they will be taken to a screen with a list of available workouts, and they can select the time and number of reps for each workout. The app will then showcase the exercize, instructions for how to do it, a timer, and a number of reps.
